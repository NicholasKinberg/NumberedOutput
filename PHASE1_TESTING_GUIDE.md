# Phase 1 Testing Guide: Continue Extension with Numbered Output

## Configuration Status ✅

The Continue extension has been successfully configured to enforce numbered output. The configuration file at `~/.continue/config.ts` now includes:

- **System message modification** that enforces numbered output for all models
- **Automatic application** to existing system messages or creation of new ones
- **Clear instructions** for the LLM to number all code suggestions and steps

## Manual Testing Steps

### 1. Restart VS Code
After the configuration changes, restart VS Code to ensure the new settings are loaded.

### 2. Open Continue Extension
1. Open VS Code
2. Look for the Continue extension in the sidebar or command palette
3. Open the Continue chat interface

### 3. Test Prompts

Try these specific prompts to verify numbered output:

#### Code Generation Test
**Prompt:** "Write a function to sort an array of numbers in JavaScript"

**Expected Output:** Should include numbered steps like:
1. Create a function declaration
2. Add parameters for the array
3. Implement the sorting logic
4. Return the sorted array

#### Step-by-Step Instructions Test
**Prompt:** "Explain how to set up a React project from scratch"

**Expected Output:** Should include numbered steps like:
1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Create a new React app using create-react-app
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Start the development server

#### Debugging Guide Test
**Prompt:** "List the steps to debug a JavaScript error"

**Expected Output:** Should include numbered steps like:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Identify the line number where the error occurs
3. Examine the code around that line
4. Use console.log statements to trace variable values

### 4. Verification Checklist

- [ ] All responses include numbered steps (1., 2., 3., etc.)
- [ ] Code suggestions are properly numbered
- [ ] Step-by-step instructions are numbered
- [ ] The numbering is consistent and clear
- [ ] The LLM follows the numbered format even for complex responses

### 5. Troubleshooting

If numbered output is not working:

1. **Check VS Code Restart:** Ensure VS Code was restarted after configuration changes
2. **Verify Configuration:** Run the test script: `node test-continue-config.js`
3. **Check Continue Status:** Ensure Continue extension is active and working
4. **Model Configuration:** Verify that your LLM model is properly configured in Continue

### 6. Success Criteria

Phase 1 is considered complete when:
- ✅ Continue extension is properly configured
- ✅ All test prompts produce numbered output
- ✅ The numbering format is consistent (1., 2., 3., etc.)
- ✅ Both code suggestions and step-by-step instructions are numbered

## Configuration Details

The modified configuration automatically adds this system message to all models:

```
IMPORTANT: When providing code suggestions, steps, or any structured output, ALWAYS number each item clearly (1., 2., 3., etc.). Format all code-related responses with numbered steps for better readability and organization.
```

This ensures that regardless of the underlying LLM model, all responses will follow the numbered output format.
